# 802.11ax-wifi-througput-simulator
802.11ax wifi throughput simulator project

This project is a 802.11ax simple wifi simulation code.

It is a simplified MAC protocol of 802.11ax Wi-Fi with CSMA/CA and 2 types of device 
(the legacy and new device).

It calculated the throughput and collision probability from mathematical model and simulation

Thank you
